    <p>Accompanied by the research report for the Shaping Digital Life course at the Master's program <a
        href="https://www.uva.nl/shared-content/programmas/en/masters/information-studies-information-systems/information-systems.html">Information
        Studies</a> at
      the University of Amsterdam, a 'science communication artifact' was created to communicate the content of the
      research
      report.</p>

    <p>The research report investigates blockchain, more concretely the impact of digital
      currencies (cryptocurrencies) through
      an <em>inclusive</em> lens focusing on the accessibility of cryptocurrencies in relation to 'traditional'
      financial
      services based on prediction Nº 7; <em>The Internet will become ‘the Internets’ as access, systems, and
        principles are
        renegotiated</em> as stated in the article titled <a
        href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2014/03/11/digital-life-in-2025/">Digital Life in 2025 </a>by the Pew
      Research Center. </p>

    <p>For this study an interactive prototype of a Bitcoin node was created using a
      microcontroller with a storage device and blockchain software was installed to create
      a
      working <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node">Bitcoin node</a> to receive and store transactions. This build
      log shows the process of setting up the
      prototype of the node.</p>

    <h2 id="hardware">Gathering the hardware</h2>
    <p>To run a full Bitcoin node two main hardware components are needed. A microcontroller using an ARM chipset that
      has wifi capabilities. A popular option, and the microcontroller we will be using for this project, is a <a
        href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/">Raspberry
        Pi Model 4 B</a> with at least 4GB of RAM. This microcontroller is a great balance between cost (around 40
      euros),
      processing power, and connection ports. This microcontroller will run the node software. The second main hardware
      component is a hard drive (preferably an SSD) with around 1TB of storage. This will be used to store the complete
      blockchain ledger of
      Bitcoin to date. </p>

      <figcaption>Figure 1: Overview of all hardware</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Additionally, some other hardware components are needed to make a fully operating node. A power supply to power
      the microcontroller, an SD card to install the software, and an ethernet cable to
      connect the node to the internet.</p>

    <p>A full node is likely to operate 24/7, the Raspberry PI is able to handle this workload
      but it is recommended to cool the CPU to make it not overheat. For this reason, a <a
        href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3723561">3D printed enclosure</a> (credits to Thingiverse user Malolo
      for
      the design)
      for the Raspberry Pi with active fan cooling was printed.</p>

  <section>
    <h2 id="software">Installing the software</h2>
    <p>Several software packages exist for hosting a Bitcoin full node (e.g. Umbrel, Voltage, Start9) but after
      researching the projects <a href="https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz">RaspiBlitz</a> suited this prototype the
      most. It's completely open-source, easy to install if you
      know you're way around the terminal, has a decent user interface and it's completely self-hosted. You are not
      reliant on any third-party cloud service. </p>


    <p>The focus of the project is also entirely Bitcoin and <a href="https://lightning.network">Lightning</a> so many
      additional services (e.g. BTCPay) can be installed as plugins. The goal of the RaspiBlitz is
      mainly targeted at learning how to run your own node decentralized from home. There are 168 contributors
      working on the project and receiving regular updates. v1.8 was released in November 2022 and has been running
      stably
      since then, no security breaches to date.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="/images/flashing.jpg">
      <figcaption>Figure 3: Flashing the SD card</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>To install the software, it is downloaded from the GitHub release page which gives a <code>.img</code> file.
      To verify the software a quick verification of the image was performed by using the shasum command on the
      downloaded image <code>shasum -a 256 raspiblitz-v1.8.0c-2022-11-01.img.gz.</code>
    </p>

    <p>Now the image can be flashed to the MicroSD Card. For this <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher">Balena
        Etcher</a> was used. You select the image, select
      the storage device (SD Card), and hit flash. After 10 minutes or so (the image is around 3GB) this process is
      completed and you have the software installed on the SD card.</p>


  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 id="setup">Setting up the Node</h2>
    <p>Now it's time to actually setup the node. The SD card is inserted into the microcontroller, connected to power,
      and ethernet and the storage device for the ledger is connected using USB. Only thing left to do is to give it a
      proper spot in a closed at home.
    </p>

    <figure class="fullwidth">
      <img src="/images/homelab.jpg">
      <figcaption>Figure 4: Node running in my homelab</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>After the device is connected and powered on it is reachable over a home network by using the terminal and
      <code>SSH</code>. The IP address of the Raspberry Pi can be found in the network software of the home router.
      Using the <code>ssh admin@[xxxxx]</code> command with the correct IP and password RaspiBlitz you are logged into
      the device and prompted with a set up screen. The steps are described in the readme.md file of the RaspiBlitz
      project on GitHub so going into detail here is unnecessary but the setup process basically guides you through two
      things:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Creating a lightning wallet:</strong> the set up screen asks to set up a password for the web interface
      and
      your
      wallets. After that, the layer-2 lightning wallet is created a seed phrase will be shown which is important to
      write down. This gives
      access to the funds if the hardware fails. It allows you to recover your wallet.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Copying the full Blockchain ledger to the hard drive:</strong> self-validating all the blocks to the
      hard drive
      takes around 8-9 days so for the prototype the option was picked to copy the bitcoin core from my laptop which
      took about 12h.
    </p>

    <p>That's it! After rebooting and logging back in the full node is up and running!</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 id="transaction">Testing Transactions</h2>
    <p>The software provided a nice web-based user interface for connecting to the node and making transactions to the
      wallet. To test the workings of the wallet a small amount was deposited to the account.</p>

    <p>First, we need to have Bitcoin. Many options can be considered in getting the first bitcoin. Running mining
      software, having a friend who already owns Bitcoin make a transaction but probably the route most users will go
      through is buying Bitcoin with Fiat currency on an exchange such as Bitvavo or a spot website such as Bitonic. For
      this prototype, we will be using <a href="https://bitonic.nl/en">Bitonic</a>. The downside of these exchanges and
      spot websites are that they are
      required by law to do a Know Your Customer (KYC) process making your transaction in theory not completely private.
    </p>

    <figure class="fullwidth">
      <img src="/images/install.jpg">
      <figcaption>Figure 4: Keys and seed words after install</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>On the Bitonic website, 100 euro was transferred using iDeal which at its current valuation price is roughly
      0.00392426 BTC or 392426 <a href="https://sat.trading">Satoshis</a> (fractions of Bitcoin). The Bitcoin amount is
      sent to the BTC address that
      corresponds with a <a href="https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s-plus">Nano Ledger S</a> cold wallet.
    </p>


    <figure class="fullwidth">
      <img src="/images/ledger.jpeg">
      <figcaption>Figure 5: Ledger cold wallet connected</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Once the funds were added to the Nano cold wallet a transaction was made to the node running in the Homelab. This
      was done using an on-chain transaction with Ride the Lightning which can be installed as a plugin in RaspiBlitz.
      In the <a href="https://github.com/Ride-The-Lightning/RTL">Ride the Lightning</a> dashboard an on-chain address
      can be created to send funds too. Since the Nano Ledger
      doesn't fully support lightning transactions it's good practice to first transfer the funds to a
      lighting-optimized 'hot wallet' such as a smartphone wallet which can be installed through the iOS app store. For
      this
      prototype, the <a href="https://bluewallet.io">Blue Wallet</a> was downloaded. So in short:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>BTC was bought on Bitonic</li>
      <li>Send to the Nano Ledger</li>
      <li>Part of the funds sent to the Blue Wallet</li>
      <li>From the Blue Wallet to the self-hosted Node</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Once the transaction is made the transaction gets an ID which you can view in the <a
        href="https://mempool.space">Mempool</a> waiting for
      confirmations
      of
      blocks in the blockchain. After around 3 confirmations the ledger approved the transaction and the funds are on
      the wallet of the node!</p>

    <p>Now the sky is the limit! Everything is in place to send and receive BTC and Lightning transactions.</p>
