  <section>
    <p>Accompanyed to the research report for the Shaping Digital Life course at the Master's programm Information
      Studies at the University of Amsterdam, a 'science communication artefact' was created to communicate the content
      of the research report. </p>

    <p>The research report investigates blockchain, more concretely the impact of digital
      currencies (cryptocurrencies) trough
      an <em>inclusive</em> lens focussing on the accessibility of cryptocurrencies in relation to 'traditional'
      financial
      services based on prediction Nº 7; <em>The Internet will become ‘the Internets’ as access, systems, and
        principles are
        renegotiated</em> as stated in the article titled Digital Life in 2025 by the Pew Research Center. </p>

    <p>For this study an interactive prototype of a Bitcoin node was created using a
      microcontroller (Raspberry Pi) with a storage device and blockchain software (Raspiblitz) was installed to create
      a
      working Bitcoin node to receive and store transactions. This build log shows the process of setting up the
      prototype of the node.</p>

    <h2>Gathering the hardware</h2>
    <p>To run a full Bitcoin node two main hardware components are needed. A microcontroller using an ARM chipset that
      has wifi capabilities. A popular option, and the microcontroller we will be using for this project, is a Raspberry
      Pi Model 4 with atleast 4gb of RAM. This microcontroller is a great balance between cost (around 40 euros),
      processing power and connection ports. This microcontroller will run the node software. The second main hardware
      component is a hard drive with around 1TB of storage. This will be used to store the complete blockchain ledger of
      Bitcoin to date. </p>

    <p>Additionally, some other hardware components are needed to make a fully operating node. A power supply to power
      the microcontroller, an SD card to install the software and create back-ups and preferabbly an ethernet cable to
      connect the node to the internet.</p>

    <p>A full node is likely to operate 24/7, due to it's pcb structure a Raspberry PI is able to handle this workload
      but it is recommended to cool the CPU to make it not overheat. For this reason I deciced to 3D print an enclosure
      for the raspberry pi with active fan cooling.</p>
